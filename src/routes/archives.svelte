<!--Setting up a prototype page for 3D archive rendering -->
<Heading>THE ARCHIVES</Heading>
<body>
	This page will allow users to view currently archived exhbits, or previously available exhibits that are no longer stored by the museum.
	This is suggested to include 3D renderings of the exhibits, to allow academics to study pieces without needing to gain access to archives.
